                  Cats are the only species that have been domesticated in the family of Felidae, and there are estimated around 720 million pet and stray cats around the world. These furry (and non-furry) felines are thought to have first been domesticated around 7500 BC (that is 9,500 years ago) and today are a loved member of the family in many households. But what other fun and interesting things do we know about our feline friends?
