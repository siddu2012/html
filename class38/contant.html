                Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a savory dish of

Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened

wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients 
(such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), 
which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1]
 A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta.
 A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

        Pastry refers to a variety of doughs, as well as the sweet and savoury baked

goods made from them.
 These goods are often called pastries as a synecdoche,
  and the dough may be accordingly called pastry dough for clarity.
 Sweetened pastries are often described as bakers' confectionery
