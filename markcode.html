                pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of<mark> wheat 
                flour</mark> mixed with water or eggs, and <code>formed into sheets or other shapes, 
                then cooked by boiling or baking</code>.
                 Pasta was originally only made with durum,
                  although the definition has been expanded to include alternatives for a gluten-free diet,
                   such as rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils.
                    Pasta is believed to have developed independently in Italy and is a staple food of Italian cuisine,
                [1][2] with evidence of Etruscans making pasta as early as 400 BCE in Italy.[3][4]
